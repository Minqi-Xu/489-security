Q1
Before accessing data containing important information, add authentication (e.g. password) to protect it, ensure important data can not be easily obtained by strangers.

Q2
Display less useful information on the locked screen, especially information that is helpful or potentilly helpful for obtaining passwords. (i.e. in the assignment, Camera_3115 is quite useful to get some other information).
Also, use passwords that is more complex, for example, adding the digit number, or mixing letters, symbols, and numbers together.

Q3
Do not post any information about usernames and passwords on web pages that anyone can browse. (e.g. in the assignment, all possible username and password pairs are listed in the instruction page. Hackers can simply type all combinations and login to the router)
Also, make usernames and passwords less standardized. (e.g. in the assignment, the usernames are simply Admin, or Root, or Shinra followed with admin or root. And passwords are simply "root" or "admin". These kinds of usernames and passwords are easy to guess even if we have no information about them.

Q4
Before the guards executes the command, some verification procedures should be added. For example, adding voice feature recognition to confirm that it is not an illegal person issuing instructions.
Also, to prevent voice imitation in some ways, 2-FA can be added to ensure the legitimacy of the command source.

Q5
The lock should add some authentication method to ensure that the reply comes from a legitimate server to avoid similar attacks in the assignments or MITM attacks. Encrypting the text is a way to acheive this. For example, using signatures or public-key authenticated encryption, or even using Certification Authorities digital certification.
